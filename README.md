## Project Overview

This repository contains all the code, documentation, and resources for a facial expression classification project using neural networks. The goal is to build, train, and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of recognizing basic human emotions—happy, sad, angry, surprised, fearful, disgusted, and neutral—from grayscale face images.

Key components:

- Data ingestion and preprocessing pipeline
- CNN architecture design and training scripts
- Model evaluation and visualization tools
- This project was developed as part of a university course on neural networks and deep learning.

## Motivation

Understanding and classifying human facial expressions is a cornerstone of affective computing. Applications range from human-computer interaction (HCI) and driver monitoring systems to mental health assessments and social robotics. By training a neural network to accurately distinguish between common emotional states, we aim to:

1. Demonstrate proficiency in implementing CNNs for image classification.
2. Gain experience with popular datasets (e.g., FER-2013) and preprocessing techniques (normalization, augmentation).
3. Explore performance trade-offs between network depth, regularization, and data augmentation.
4. Provide a modular codebase that can be extended to more nuanced or real-time expression recognition tasks.
